The Authcode field make this link work (http://0.0.0.0/login?email=1@example.com&authcode=1234),
u can attach it in a email and u dont have to type a password to log in.

The Email field is used to login just like the Password Field.

The Color Field u can choose what color which person chats in.

The Username field is for what name that person should chat with.

# Bugs
For now the only bug i know of is that if u login with the authcode u cant send files
